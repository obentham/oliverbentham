## About Me

Hello! I'm Oliver, a PhD student studying Computer Science at the [Kahlert School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/), University of Utah advised by [Prof. Vivek Srikumar](https://svivek.com/). I spend my time working on problems at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Prior to joining [Utah's NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.utah.edu/), I worked as a senior machine learning engineer at The Washington Post for two years, where I developed and deployed models for revenue optimization and targeted advertising. Before my time at the Post, I was a machine learning engineer at Alion Science and Technology.

I received my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in 2019.

## Research Interests

In my research, I want to explore sustainable and efficient alternatives to current NLP modeling methods, without compromising on quality. The current generation of large language models seem to constantly be growing (GPT-4 is [rumored to have 1.76 trillion parameters](https://medium.com/@mlubbad/the-ultimate-guide-to-gpt-4-parameters-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nlps-game-changer-109b8767855a)), and, as a result:

1. The compute energy required to train/operate these models continues to grow, raising questions about whether these models justify their environmental footprint.
2. The GPU hardware required is inaccessible for most, even including many researchers in well funded labs. This makes it ever more difficult to research and understand how these models work.
3. Often, these massive models are more than a given problem requires. For many problems, smaller models achieve comparable results for a fraction the parameters.

I'm working on methods that can achieve NLP results comparable to the current state-of-the-art without trillions of parameters and inaccesible hardware demands.
